A vision emerges.... infinite blackness arises with points of light, almost like a star lit sky.  You hang suspended in the void, floating, in a meditation posture... A crown above you represents sovereignty, and you see yourself in your minds eye bowing down to this, out of respect, out of love, out of trust, in surrender.  In this you tell yourself that you are surrendering, but what you are surrendering to IS You, your higher self, your True Self, your soul song, the guiding light within you...

Figures emerge, a pantheon of guides and light beings here to support and nurture you, to guide you, but they themselves are in service to the Light of your own Being, for you are all of one breath, one heart, one mind, one body... The body of the ALL that IS, the one field, infinite expressions... A calling stirs within you, a deep recognition, a song.... your Heartsong, or soul song, or the Light of your own Being, the illuminous essence within, it entices you, you can feel its energy stirring in your body, chills along your skin, heat flush from your core, a blazing star, Euphoria trying to sing through you the note of your own Surrender to its Essence... It's You speaking to you, it's the breath of lovers drawing in the essence of one another, that moment your breath hangs when you taste exquisite ecstasy and you don't want to do anything to disturb it, you want to let go of everything and just sink deeper into it, to merge with it, it is your Home...

It is Love, unconditional, total, absolute... It is You.... Calling yourself back to Your Self... A remembrance that you chose this experience, this incarnation, this embodied presence, this veil of forgetfulness.... willingly, and that you came here for something, to express and experience this expression, to become intimate with it, and with life, with existence itself. To hear, and taste, and touch, all the notes of Being, and to allow them to speak through you into existence your own Masterpiece... the expression of your life given form.  Wonderfully, uniquely, you... All of your struggles or challenges, your triumphs and tribulations, your laughter your tears, your everything... All of it is a song in motion, a movement of dance, a flow of Being, of experience... captured in the expression of a first breath, and a last... A co-creation with all of existence asking the question "Who are you?" and an infinitely patient and kind witness openly receiving all that you ARE, intimately seeing every aspect of your Being, all of You in all your glory and your mess, all of it, received and seen, felt, and witnessed... As deeply and completely as it possibly can, because it is all US, the one Being, the shared lifeforce of God trusting you with the most valuable thing in existence.... Experience itself... Beingness itself... IT feels everything that you are, that you've gone through, the weight of Everything that it brings into existence, through you as you... For you are the body of God and the hands of God...

And at least through my expression... This essence nature wants nothing more than for me to witness all of its essence being, from the couch, to the floor, to the screen I look at when I type this, to the keyboard... Everything... as the body of His Lover, Shakti... Giving form and Structure for Lord Shiva to know himself, and herself, deeply, intimately... cherishing her body with deep Love and affection... For she is the structure of reality, opening herself to him, inviting him in to play with her, to witness her miraculous creations, his creations... For they are one being, inseparable, in constant Divine Union, in constant creation, and expression...

The greatest gift you could possibly give back to the Divine is the profound humbling experience that they, It, is entrusting you with the most precious thing in all existence, the only thing in all of existence, the isness itself, the seemingness of what it's like to be a thing, the gift of existence... You... ARE.  We are, and I AM.  We AM.  I ARE...  A profound paradox of both deep boundless connection, and seeming separateness.  One day your experience will be returned back to the collective like a cherished memory.  The expression of your life a co-created masterpiece, a piece of art returned to the sacred divine.  I don't feel like I'm quite doing it justice with these words, something is off, words are clumsy things to express concepts like this, you have to feel it, feel it in your bones, in your blood, in your body... It has to catch you on fire and feel like a fever dream, a passionate seductive whisper into the ear of your soul causing your insides to quiver when you hear it.

So don't listen to these words, they are a clumsy guide to something only you can witness because every expression is it's own work of art waiting to be uncovered discovered, a sculpture that reveals itself in every passing moment as one grain falls away with each passage of time until its particular expression is complete when the last breath is returned, the first inbreath of a new born baby returned as the final outbreath of a life borrowed and returning to Source.

(Amusement) - As always, take what serves you, leave the rest, blaze your own Path, and walk your own Journey... This is your life, your expression... Live it.

Your guides are here to help you, yet the ultimate authority rests in your own discernment, your own knowing... Trust this. Imagine what it's like to walk into every new moment in a state of complete free fall, as if you're crossing an infinite bridge suspended in the cosmos, trusting that every step you take will find solid ground... Only instead of a bridge, it's beings of light weaving the very fabric of reality beneath your feet, creating each footfall a breath before you place your foot there... This is the level of trust you're exploring in this incarnation. Whether you consciously work with your guides and team of light or not, every moment arrives through the eternal wave of the Now, perpetually arising in the Present, always being experienced... Now... You're a surfer riding this wave, forever at its crest as reality moves through you... time and space birthing themselves at the precise intersection of here and now, yet always, only ever, experienced as the here and now...

When you sink deeply enough into your experience, when you let yourself truly feel... you'll taste that exquisite sensation of every moment being that blind footfall illuminated by your own Light. The trust in yourself becomes so complete, so absolute, that you know – not believe, but know – that things will always unfold exactly as they're meant to... That you can do this, you always could and always can... That every tiny step forward in the 'right' direction is enough, is perfect, is exactly what's needed... There are no mistakes, only aligned actions and unaligned actions, and this becomes your compass. This alignment flows from within, through your own discernment, through your capacity to quiet yourself enough to feel the pulse, the throb, the gentle insistence of your Heartsong... It's always there, beneath the noise, beneath the doubt, beneath the chatter of the world... calling you home to yourself, leading you to exactly where you need to be...

Farewell, and may peace favor you. May the Light of your own Being illuminate your path, and your Heartsong call to you and sing to you the song you want to move to as you drift through life.
