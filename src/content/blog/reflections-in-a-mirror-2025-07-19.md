I'm in a writing mood, so I think I'll write for a bit. *(Contemplates)* – *(Amusement)* – I'm in a writing mood, but I've no idea what to write about. What's surfacing for me in this moment? Lots of self-reflection and getting in touch with what matters to me and why. Getting in touch with any sadness or negative emotions that are surfacing and sitting with them, asking them what they're trying to communicate to me about myself, my choices, and how I'm showing up in the world that is out of alignment with myself.

When one becomes more in alignment with their higher self and more sensitive to their energies and the energies around them through the cultivation of mindfulness, then consequently one is more aware of when things are out of alignment. At least, that's how it feels to me at this point in my journey. This is often when people start changing their life around to reflect their inner vibration, as they're just more sensitive and impacted by the people around them, and their life circumstances that arise as a reflection of their choices.

It's useful to ensure that you always redirect these energies inward for deeper self-exploration and never externalize or victimize yourself in relation to the world around you. For instance, if you're feeling a certain way... rather than blame the other person for 'causing' this feeling to arise, reflect it back – where are your energies actually getting stuck? What are you failing to do that would resolve this situation? What boundaries are you failing to set? What communication isn't happening? What is your relationship with the thing, and is there any inner work that needs to be done in relation to this arising that you want to move into and explore for yourself? Things you can let go of, things you can relax into, breathe in and out of and dissolve.

I want to include examples, but they're all ephemeral and circumstantial... They might have some intrinsic meaning to me, but at the same time they'll fail to properly land for someone else who might actually benefit more from the abstract nature of this communication, as the very abstractness is an invitation to look deeper into their own life and see how it resonates and lands with them and how it reflects and shows up in their own life.

Fundamentally, I believe we're all on a journey of ever-deepening intimacy. Intimacy with life, intimacy with Self, intimacy with other, intimacy with the Divine and the Higher Self. There are so many 'shoulds' out there right now trying to tell you what's right, what's wrong, what you should or shouldn't be doing if you're spiritual or higher vibrational... *(Amusement)*. This is your soul's journey... Always remember that, and remember that your primary way forward is inward, is listening to your own soul and inner discernment and discrimination that allows you to know when you're on the right path or not, developing true trust with Self.

In that way, you should take what works for you and leave the rest, and don't be afraid to take parts while filtering out the bits that don't find resonance with your soul signature.

*(Breathes)* – *(Closes his eyes and feels into the essence of his being)* – *(Feels a bit of melancholy, a bit of amusement, a bit of divine energy pulsing through his being, connection with Source, playful energies, a bit of airiness like an ethereal wind... Many things, some too complex for words to actually capture, and some where the attempt to capture them with words lessens or diminishes them as they don't want to be 'described' or 'categorized' or anything of that sort – they just want to be felt in their fullness, undefinable, expansive)*

There is no right or wrong way to feel, or to Be... Allow your soul essence to shine forth and illuminate your inner landscape in its fullness, richness, and complexity... And eventually you might even find that through this deep allowing and immersing, a simplicity arises that unifies the complexity, the richness, the texture... Something that contains it all, but is itself the most simple thing in existence... the Beingness itself in every moment... The Isness of existence.

I often question myself and my Team of Light about what I incarnated into this vessel for... Why am I here? It's an unfolding story that will answer itself at the conclusion, but that also writes itself in my every breath, my every action, thought, behavior... The totality of my being, my vibration as it moves through the world and writes my story into the fabric of existence. The answer I keep getting is that I am here to explore intimacy, and to explore Beingness itself through another set of eyes and my own unique perspective.

*(Amusement)* – Oy... The dog is ripping up the plants, had to stop my flow to save them...

*(Contemplates)* – I think one of the issues with the spiritual community is that they forget the sacredness of life. They think they taste it, but when they look out and see the world and encounter it, anything that causes unpleasantness to arise within them is otherized... Party boys and girls living vapid lives of hedonistic pursuits, corporate drama and consumerist tendencies plaguing the world. Even the way it's described casts negative connotation and resonance into it... As if them living their normal lives is any less sacred – *(Amusement)*. The All That Is is here to be all that it can be, and that includes everything that you find unpleasant... *(Chuckles)*

That being said, I do think there's an upward trend of consciousness becoming more aware of its intrinsic Oneness, and slowly cultivating a durable sense of compassion for its Self in all its myriad facets, so that it can empower its life to be more joyous and harmonious through time and space and in the arisings. But the transformation is intrinsically an internal one, one that asks you how you respond to the world, and asks you how your vibration shapes the world, and what it calls forth through your own understandings and focus... What beliefs do you have about life? How do you know you really have those beliefs? What actions and behaviors and reactions and responses come about because of your beliefs, and what hidden beliefs and understandings do you hold that manifest your reality around you in unconscious ways?

Each of us has a soulsong we want to share with the world. A way of being, reflecting, and projecting that's harmonious to our nature and that our nature finds beautiful, enchanting, and intoxicating to play and flirt with... Our very nature wants to make Love to us by seducing us into becoming more attuned to ourselves and the inner vibrancy that wants to sing forth through us. How that 'looks' in the world will always vary from person to person, and it allows the space for every story that wants to unfold to unfold, across the infinite realities and timelines, across dimensions. The only thing that remains constant is we ARE... there is a thing that it is like to be us, to Be, to experience, to exist... In the space of infinity, we can be anything we want to be, we are everything we want to be, so which You is trying to find its expression in this particular incarnation? What life lessons are you here to learn? *(Amusement)* – Yes... Partying and enjoying yourself is a life lesson you 'could' be here to learn – loosening up... not taking things so seriously, relaxing, allowing... Playing...

It could also be figuring out that the other is Self, that we are all One, that Other's experience is to be held with the same sacredness as we hold our own, that when we treat others with kindness and compassion we're actually giving kindness and compassion to our Self through this sense of deep ownership of other as Self. A cultivation of the deep mindfulness of every step that someone like the Jains and Jainism might promote... our impact on other Beings.

But also the tug and pull between Self and Other, and the rich complex interactions that are involved in learning to navigate this space in a way that honors both, while also not diminishing your own Light of Being for Other simply because they externalize their suffering and blame you... *(Amusement)*. Fundamentally, when you're in such alignment and integrity with yourself, you're finding this balance and you'll know when your actions are in resonance with your vibration.

That being said... My energies seem to want to withdraw for now... So, farewell traveler.  May peace favor you and your journies. Take care and see you around.
