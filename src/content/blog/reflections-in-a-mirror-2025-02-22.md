Spirit directed me to write today instead of playing some more Hades... *(Amusement)*. However, they didn't give me anything to write about… Just got the vague disappointment energy spiked when I opened the game, which prompted me to check in with Spirit following my intuition.  A series of yes no questions later, and here I am… Writing but unsure what to write about.  *(Chuckles)*

So, I suppose I'll write about life in general.  I've been getting back into meditation after a short sabbatical, though even my meditation sabbaticals still have meditation in them, as at this point it's just part of who I am to meditate every now and then. That being said, it's like the difference between 30 minutes a day and a few hours a day spread out in 30-minute to one-hour bursts. Some of it isn't really meditation but rather tuning into light language, and just receiving the energy found in it. But, since anything can be the object of meditation, meditating on light codes still counts as meditation to me.

Shiva and Shakti are calling me again.  The contemplation of their divine Love and Union often triggers a cascading effect of awesome to just roll around inside my body, but it isn't quite to the level it should be is what I intuitively feel.  There is deep kinship and affection towards them, I Love them, and I'm very grateful to their existence.  When I'm in my non-dual contemplative states the feelings are even more intense as I remove the separation between me and Shiva and me and Shakti, her body is my body, my animating spirit is Shiva exploring his lover intimately, Shakti has such a deep craving to have Shiva inside her, exploring her in all the ways she can be explored, *her body is a wonderland, laid bare for Shiva's gaze to wander her body taking in her sights…*. All of us, every possible perspective that could ever be, every subjective experience to be had is Lord Shiva exploring both himself and Lady Shakti.  My essence is of their essence, and we are kindred spirits intimately bound together as one and the same, yet distinct… I'm not sure yet what my shard of consciousness is meant to explore.  I'm still awaiting my passion to stir me, the closest thing to such is my intense desire for Unity in the most carnal ways possible…. *(Smirks)*.  There is a deep craving for intimacy that is but a pale reflection of the intimacy shared between Lord Shiva and Shakti.  When I contemplate Shakti as Shiva and see through the eyes of Shiva, the feelings are very potent but still not potent enough, as if I should be consumed by them, ravaged by them, madden by them, as if they should be the all of my existence in its purest form, I want to be consumed and devoured by my own carnal Lust and at the same time breath in the deepest intimacy that can exist as an exquisite nectar and take it into my heart and Radiate out a divine Love as if I'm the Sun shedding light on all creation….

This life is but a pale reflection of something greater than ourselves, playing out it's cosmic dance to a music only it can hear, *a thrum, a pulse, a vibration…*. The heartbeat of life, heartbeat of creation itself… Spiraling through all that is in an ever expanding fractal…  Sometimes in my moments of contemplation, I am Shiva impregnating Shakti, and as my seed ejaculates into her, all of me is swept up into her womb and I give birth to myself, feeling the sacred of ultimate act of creation, and from there I become the spark of life, the wellspring of creation and creativity itself, a permutation of springing forth that brings all that is into existence. Across time, across space, across dimensions… *(Smirks) (Amusement)*…. The Big O of the Universe… A cosmic bang.

Anyway, I feel my words drawing short now; all that wanted to be expressed in this transmission has been. Farewell for now, reader. May these words echo out into the cosmos and reach the eyes of those who need to see, and…

*May peace favor you, may your light illuminate your path, and you find your way to wherever you're meant to be on this cosmic journey.*
