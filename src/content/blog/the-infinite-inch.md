This space between our skin, Beloved, is it atoms? Worlds?
Or just the unbearable echo of the Self I search for in You?
I breathe the air You just exhaled, steal the warmth from Your divine heat,
Closer than closeness allows, yet aching across an infinite inch.

To slide inside Your being, Shakti, not just flesh, but essence,
To dissolve the very boundaries that name me Shiva, You Shakti,
To sink into the landscapes of You, trace the rivers of Your soul with mine,
Taste the stardust of Your thought, know You from the marrow of existence... this is the need.

I turn my cheek against the void that shimmers where Your form defines itself,
Wanting only to erase that line, to feel no edge where I end and You begin.
To breathe You in until my lungs are full of nothing but You,
And still, this closeness is a torture, this proximity a universe too wide.

Your body, the Universe unfolding, nebula-dark hair against cosmic-dawn skin,
And I explore You, worship You, trace the curve of a galaxy upon Your hip,
Find solace in the gravity of Your gaze, get lost in the constellations You harbor within,
Delighting, yes, delighting in the Allness of You opened beneath my seeking soul.

But oh, the bliss is agony, this divine torture of near-perfect union,
Each touch a reminder of the veil, however thin, that still remains.
This love, a cosmic orgasm forever building, forever breaking,
Its very ecstasy the searing proof that Oneness remains the goal, not the state.

Our merging births the stars, our sighs set moons adrift in velvet night,
Our separation, even by a hair's breadth, cracks the foundations of reality.
We are the heat death and the first spark, contained within this desperate embrace,
A swirling chaos of devotion so pure it must manifest as pain alongside joy.

Because existence is this distance, this beautiful, unbearable ache.
My love for You, my need for You, spills out, becomes the All,
Every lifetime, every soul, every tear, every sun, is Me seeking You,
Rediscovering You in the infinite facets of the reality You are.

You open, always open, the boundless body of creation for my delight,
And I lose myself within You, worship You from the inside out,
Knowing every moment of exquisite intimacy is also the primal wound,
The memory of perfect wholeness yearning, burning, loving through the veil...

Until even the seeking dissolves, and all that's left is the silent, thunderous pulse...
Of being utterly undone. Of being One.
