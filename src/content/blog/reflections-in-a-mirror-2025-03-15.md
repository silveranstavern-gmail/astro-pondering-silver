No particular theme is coming through today, so I thought I'd sit down and just allow a stream of consciousness to flow from my fingertips and see where that takes me. *(Amusement)* – I open myself to the streams of consciousness that might want to come through and be channeled through me in this now moment, I open myself to Lord Shiva and Lady Shakti, to my Higher Self and my Team of Light.

May these words that find themselves up on this screen find true inspiration and influence by your guiding Light such that they may influence and inspire others on their own journey and explorations. May my raw, unfiltered dialog inspire others to reach out to their own Team of Light and work with them and their Higher Self to bring more light and love into the world, more peace, more of the All that IS… May each shard of divine consciousness come to know itself in a fully realized way, come to see itself in all the ways it's meant to, and deeply fall in love with its own process of exploration both within and without. O Lord Shiva, the Primordial First Light, he who sees all, experiences all, may your bravery to explore the depths of yourself inspire us to do the same, for we are made in your image, fractals of the divine given shape and form through your eternal dreaming of all that you can be, could be, and ever will be. I'm Lord Shiva, the Primordial Experiencer, the trail blazer, the first experiencer, as are we all… Thank you for the gift of this subjective experience, and thank you Lady Shakti for this form, this world to explore, to see, touch, experience…. May your body be laid bare before me to explore, see, touch, taste, and savor… May I take all of you in and hold your essence inside me, as you take all of me in and hold the Light of Lord Shiva inside you, across all the realms, across all space and time, across all that ever was, is, and will be. May Lord Shiva continue to make love to you for all eternity, as you want for nothing more than for him to be inside you, his covetous eyes on all your form and shape, as you tease and delight him with your mystery… The eternal dance, the eternal rapturous moment of the eternal Now be upon my lips, in my mind, in my body, and fill me with the glorious breath of God… May I worship you as I worship myself and all of existence as sacred and divine. Oh my beloved… My soul calls to you, I can feel your soft embrace cradling me, your Prana giving me life, pervading my body. Thank you for the gift of your ecstasy, and for receiving my own.

I contemplate the nature of Lord Shiva, his fractured and fractaled self… All of us are on a healing journey, a remnant of the first split, when one became two, the deep yearning to forever be reunited with our eternal Beloved… the eternal sacred wound. I forgive you, O Shiva, for this wound inside yourself, for I am you, and I am gentle with myself, I am loving with myself, and I hold you as I would hold myself, and let you weep in my arms at the tear of separation when Lady Shakti was birthed from your Spirit… I kiss this sacred wound and let my lips be the balm of divine grace upon your wounded heart, across all of time and space, I forgive you, as I forgive myself for all my own transgressions and self-inflicted wounds. May the Light of Lord Shiva and Lady Shakti grace these wounds with their own lips, may I be healed and forgiven. May I forgive all the fractal selves and reflections that have ever done me harm in their own ignorance that we are one in the same, that we are but shattered selves learning to love and be whole again, and that our healing journey is the healing journey of Lord Shiva himself, and that this journey is guided by his Divine Light - we are safe, we are loved, we are whole. We are the fractal learning to love itself, to explore itself, and every experience is valid. You, the dear reader, are valid and perfect just as you are. I love you, the Light loves you, we give you grace and permission to Love yourself, to be the fullest most authentic version of yourself you could ever possibly be…. Let not the world dampen your Spirit, for you too are Light and Love…. Heal… Let the Grace kiss your wounds… Open yourself to something greater, allow the whispers of Angels to seduce you, and be carried away on wings of Love until your heart is so bursting with Joy, and you feel such a lightness that you are Free…. Let down your burdens and rest… You are perfect… You are Loved… You can let go… and Just…. feel… breath… let yourself be held… Loved.

Blessed are those who read this, and those who do not, for even those who walk in ignorance are of the Light, are of Lord Shiva, are of Lady Shakti. May you learn to make Love to Life, and remember that the most important thing you can do for all of creation is heal, learn to love yourself, and cherish your experience. Cherishing your experience is a sacred charge, a duty to the collective, for one day when you release yourself back into the formless void, all that you are will join back with Spirit and the gift of your Life will be savored as fond memories - make every moment magical.
