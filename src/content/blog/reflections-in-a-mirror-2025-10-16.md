I watched a video "The Hardest Truth I Have Learned in 20 Years of Non-Duality"; in it, the speaker illuminates a difficulty they had wherein through their Non-Dual pursuit they lost touch with their humanity and had become a little cold, distant, and detached.  This is a common rumbling/murmur I hear about some strains of Non-Duality, especially one's that are world denying and that affirm that reality is an Illusion to be transcended in some way.  That's a gross oversimplification, but it highlights the mechanisms at play.

**The belief that Reality (capital R) and appearance/experience are fundamentally separate or hierarchically ordered, with one being "more real" than the other.**

From this flows several connected beliefs:

**1. The ontological devaluation of the phenomenal world.** If Brahman/the Absolute is "truly real" and the world is maya/illusion/empty, then the world has a lower ontological status. It's not *as real*. This naturally creates a subtle (or not-so-subtle) hierarchy of value.

**2. Liberation requires transcendence \*from\* rather than \*into\*.** You must escape, transcend, or see through the world, not engage with it more deeply. The goal is to get *out* of the illusion, not to transform your relationship with it while remaining in it. This creates an implicit antagonism – the world becomes the obstacle.

**3. The self/consciousness is radically separate from content.** You are the witness, not the witnessed. The seer, not the seen. This creates a subject-object split that, paradoxically, persists even in "non-duality" – you're still standing apart from experience, just at a "higher" level. This breeds detachment naturally.

**4. Embodied life is inherently compromising to realization.** Relationships, desires, creativity, engagement – these are seen as *entanglements* rather than expressions of consciousness. They're what keep you bound.

The **underlying assumption**: that awakening means *leaving something behind* rather than *integrating something new*.

On the other hand, there is a different way of thinking about things.

What if Reality and appearance aren't hierarchically ordered but *ecstatically entangled*? What if the Absolute doesn't stand apart from the world but *enters it completely, becomes it, makes love to it*?

This is the vision that emerges from a different non-dual lineage – one drawn from Kashmir Shaivism and amplified through teachers like Osho: the recognition of Shiva and Shakti, consciousness and creative power, not as a vertical hierarchy but as eternal lovers. Shiva doesn't transcend Shakti's dance; he enters it. He explores her body in all its manifestations. And Shakti, in turn, entices him deeper – into sensation, into form, into the exquisite particularity of embodied existence.

From this understanding flows a radically different set of beliefs:

1. **The phenomenal world isn't devalued – it's the substance of divinity itself.** Everything is Shakti, the creative play of consciousness. The sensory, the embodied, the relational – these aren't illusions to see through but invitations to sink deeper into Being.
2. **Liberation requires not transcendence \*from\* but transcendence \*into\*.** You don't escape the world; you arrive in it more completely. The goal isn't to get out of the dance but to dance so fully, so presently, that every movement becomes an expression of the Divine itself.
3. **The self and content aren't separate – they're in constant, intimate communion.** You are both the seer and the seen, both Shiva and Shakti. The apparent subject-object split dissolves not into witness-consciousness standing apart, but into participatory union. You're *in* it, *as* it.
4. **Embodied life isn't compromising to realization – it's the very substance through which realization lives.** Relationships, desires, creativity, sensation – these are the language through which consciousness knows itself. They're not entanglements but love letters written by the Divine to itself.

The underlying assumption: that awakening means *integrating everything* rather than *leaving anything behind*.



Inspired by this fragment:

> From the perspective of fullness, of Lord Shiva playing with himself, of incarnating into an embodied state to explore something, to experience something through you, through experience itself – through the dance of form and formless, of arising and falling away, of the swirl – Shiva and Shakti playing with one another, loving one another, making love to one another. Shiva exploring the body of Shakti in all the ways she can manifest, and Shakti enticing Shiva to enter her, to explore her, to penetrate her, savoring the experience of deeply allowing Lord Shiva in – the fullness of existence and expression. Euphoric. Ecstatic. Union.
>
> So much more that cannot be expressed in words. The taste of a form of non-duality that asks you, begs you, to sink into Being so fully, so completely, so exquisitely that everything becomes ecstasy – for it is all Shakti, it is all Shiva. And as Shiva or Shakti, you savor your lover in all of his or her forms, in all the delicious ways....
